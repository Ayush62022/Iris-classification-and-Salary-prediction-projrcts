# Iris classifiaction
## In my Iris classification project using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, I followed a structured approach to achieve accurate species classification for Iris flowers:

 Data Collection:  Obtained the Iris dataset, which includes sepal and petal measurements for three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

 Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by addressing missing values, ensuring data consistency, and standardizing features for uniformity.

 Train-Test Split: Divided the dataset into training and testing sets to assess model generalization.

 KNN Implementation: Implemented the KNN algorithm, selecting an appropriate value for 'k' (number of neighbors) and defining a suitable distance metric (e.g., Euclidean).

 Hyperparameter Tuning: Conducted parameter optimization, fine-tuning 'k' and exploring distance metric variations for optimal model performance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test data to measure its effectiveness in classifying Iris species.

Conclusion: Demonstrated the success of the KNN algorithm in accurately classifying Iris flowers, highlighting its simplicity and efficacy for this specific classification task. This project underscores the importance of data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning in machine learning model development.


#  salary prediction project using linear regression:

Data Collection: Gathered a dataset with four columns: TV, Radio, Newspaper, and Sales.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data, handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.

Feature Selection: Focused on TV, Radio, and Newspaper as predictors to estimate salary (Sales).

Linear Regression Model: Implemented linear regression for salary prediction.

Model Training: Trained the linear regression model on the dataset.

Evaluation: Assessed model accuracy and performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared.

Insights: Gained insights into how TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising expenditures relate to salary predictions.

Conclusion: Demonstrated the utility of linear regression for salary estimation based on advertising spending, aiding in decision-making for marketing strategies.
